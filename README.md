# getting-started
Hello and welcome. I haven't used GitHub very much so far, so I've made a repo to get to know it. If you want to get to know me, Google my username and you'll find far more information than is reasonable.

I've been learning about development since I picked up a great book on the C programming language when I was 14. It's past time for me to do something interesting with it.
